# Machine Learning in Python Examples

Machine Learning examples are given in python for different data sets.

[Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) (Machine Learning in Python) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) (An open source machine learning framework for everyone) has been used.

Documentation is incomplete but work is in progress.
