# Machine Learning in Python Examples for Iris Data Set


This classification has been done on the dataset of forest fires taken from [UIC Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)


[Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) is one of the most popular dataset in ML.

The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.
